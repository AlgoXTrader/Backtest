This is a Pine Script code that allows you to backtest your trading strategies on TradingView.

Simply copy and paste the code into the Pine Script Editor on tradingview.com. Then, adjust the 'long' and 'short' variables based on your strategy,
define your stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) points, and you're good to go.

- You can backtest any market and timeframe without changing the pip values for SL and TP, thanks to ATR.
- Exiting with the opposite signal from your strategy is also possible.

Enjoy!
